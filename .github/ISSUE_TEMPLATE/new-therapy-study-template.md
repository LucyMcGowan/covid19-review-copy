## Questions to answer about each paper:

### Please provide 1-2 sentences introducing the study and its main findings


### Study question(s) being investigated:

#### How many/what drugs/combinations are being considered?


#### What are the main hypotheses being tested?


### Study population:

#### What is the model system (e.g., human study, animal model, cell line study)?


#### What is the sample size? If multiple groups are considered, give sample size for each group (including controls).

* number treated with treatment A
* number treated with treatment B

#### For human studies:

##### What countries/regions are considered?

##### What is the age range, gender, other relevant characteristics?

##### What is the setting of the study (random sample of school children, inpatient, outpatient, etc)?

##### What other specific inclusion-exclusion criteria are considered?

For example, do the investigators exclude patients with diagnosed neoplasms or patients over/under a certain age?


### Treatment assignment:

#### How are treatments assigned?

For example, is it an interventional or an observational study?

#### Is the study randomized?

A study can be interventional but not randomized (e.g., a phase I or II clinical trial is interventional but often not randomized).

#### Provide other relevant details about the design.

This includes possible treatment stratification (e.g., within litters for animal studies, within hospitals for human studies), possible confounding variables (e.g., having a large age range of individuals), possible risks of bias and how they are addressed (e.g., is there masking in a clinical trial? how are individuals chosen in an observational study?).


### Outcome Assessment:

#### Describe the outcome that is assessed and whether it is appropriate.

For example: Is the outcome assessed by a clinician or is it self-reported?
Is the outcome based on viral load or a functional measurement (e.g., respiratory function, discharge from hospital)?
What method is used to measure the outcome?
How long after a treatment is the outcome measured?

#### Are outcome measurements complete?

For example, are there individuals lost to follow up?

#### Are outcome measurements subject to various kinds of bias?

For example, a lack of masking in randomized clinical trials.


### Statistical Methods Assessment:

#### What methods are used for inference?

For example, logistic regression, nonparametric methods.

#### Are the methods appropriate for the study?

For example, are clustered data treated independently or are clusters adjusted for, such as different hospitals or litters?

#### Are adjustments made for possible confounders?

For example, adjustment for age, sex, or comorbidities.


### Results Summary:

#### What is the estimated association?

For example, is it an estimated odds ratio, a median difference in detected cases, etc?

#### What measures of confidence or statistical significance are provided?

For example, confidence intervals, p-values, and/or Bayes factors.


### Interpretation of results for study population:

#### Can we make a causal interpretation for the individuals in the study of drug -> outcome, such as "taking drug A improves likelihood of survival twofold over taking drug B."

For example, with a well-performed animal study or randomized trial it is often possible to infer causality.
If is an observational study, does it match up with some of the Bradford Hill criteria? https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/hill https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria

#### Are there identified side effects or interactions with other drugs?

For example, is the treatment known to cause liver damage or to not be prescribed for individuals with certain comorbities?

#### Are there specific subgroups with different findings?

For example, do individuals with a specific baseline seem to do particularly well? Be particularly cautious with respect to multiple testing here.


### Extrapolation of conclusions to other groups of individuals not specifically included in the study:

#### If the study is an animal study, which animal and how relevant is that model?

Is the model system appropriate? Is there evidence from past use that it's highly-relevant to therapeutic design in this context?

#### If it is a human study, what characteristics of the study population may support/limit extrapolation?

* Can results extrapolate easily to other similar groups? (e.g., same country, similar age groups)
* What would happen if conditions are extended in terms of dose or duration?
* Can results be extrapolated to other populations or in very different settings? (e.g., different age group, primary care setting vs emergency department etc)


### Summary of reliability

1-2 sentences on concluding remarks, including summary of strengths, weaknesses, limitations.
