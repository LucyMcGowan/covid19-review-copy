## Abstract {.page_break_before} 
Since late 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread around the world, resulting in the declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
This infectious disease is caused by the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
Research on the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the diease it causes is emerging rapidly through global scientific efforts.
The development of diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines will be critical to mitigating the impact of the virus.
Here we present a collaborative effort to organize and consolidate the rapidly emerging scientific literature related to SARS-CoV-2. 
We present information about the virus in the context of what is known about related viruses and synthesize studies emerging about the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 alongside literature about related illnesses.
A broad scientific effort to understand this pandemic and related viruses and diseases will be foundational to efforts to predict possible interventions. 
This text is an evolving and collaborative document that seeks to incorporate the ever-expanding body of information related to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.

## Introduction {.page_break_before} 

### General Background

On January 21, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) released its first report concerning what is now known as the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf].
This infectious disease came to international attention on December 31, 2019 following an announcement by national officials in China about 44 cases of a respiratory infection of unknown cause.
The first known cases were located in Wuhan City within the Hubei province of China, but the disease spread rapidly beyond Wuhan within China and subsequently around the world. 
At the time of the first situation report [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf], 282 confirmed cases had been identified, primarily in China, but also 1-2 exported cases had been identified in several neighboring countries (Thailand, Japan, and the Republic of Korea).
One week later, 4593 confirmed cases had been identified, spanning not only Asia, but also Australia, North America, and Europe [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200128-sitrep-8-ncov-cleared.pdf].
On March 11, 2020, WHO formally classified the situation as a pandemic [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200311-sitrep-51-covid-19.pdf].
By WHO Situation Report 61, released on March 20, 2020, 266,073 confirmed cases had been reported worldwide, with cases on every continent except Antarctica [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200321-sitrep-61-covid-19.pdf].
At this time, over 11,000 deaths had been reported worldwide.

[Note: Maybe add a graph here, update as new reports come out.]

COVID-19 is caused by the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus, a family of RNA viruses known to cause respiratory and intestinal infections in humans and other species.
Infectious diseases of global concern have previously been associated with coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81; @doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9]; however, neither of these reached pandemic status, owing to proper containment procedures (SARS) or intrinsic limitations in virus transmission (MERS).
Additionally, there are four endemic human coronaviruses that rarely progress beyond the mild symptoms associated with the common cold [@doi:10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9].
The precise identity of SARS-CoV-2 virus was unknown until approximately January 12, 2020, when Chinese officials released its genetic sequence to aid in worldwide efforts to diagnose the disease [@url:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf].
As researchers worldwide work to characterize SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, information about the transmission and life cycle of the virus as well as the diagnosis and treatment of the disease is emerging rapidly.
In this review, we seek to consolidate information about the virus in the context of related viruses and to synthesize what is known about the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and related diseases.
This is a real-time, collaborative effort that welcomes submissions from scientists worldwide.

### Coronaviruses: What are they, and what do we know about SARS-CoV-19?

Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that...
[Summarize relevant mechanisms for cell entry & address evidence for/against ACE2 being important]

The origin of the SARS-CoV-19 virus is not yet fully understood.
Genomic analyses and comparisons to other known coronaviruses suggest that SARS-CoV-19 is unlikely to have originated from a laboratory -- either purposely engineered and released, or escaped -- and instead evolved naturally in an animal host [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].
Among known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-19 has the closest overall sequence similarity to RaTG13 (~96%) found in a *Rhinolophus affinis* bat [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7], while the receptor binding domain (RBD) is highly similar to that of viruses found in pangolins [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.19.950253].
This suggests that SARS-CoV-19 may have originated in viral reservoirs of similar hosts, however current evidence cannot discriminate an origin of the virus before or after zoonotic transfer to humans [@doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9].

### Mechanisms of Coronavirus-driven Disease in Humans

Coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory illnesses in humans through the following possible mechanisms...

### Presentation of COVID-19

Information is rapidly becoming available about the wide range of symptoms that can be associated with COVID-19 as well as the range of symptom severity, onset from exposure, and possible risk or protective factors...

### Vaccines for Viruses: Strategies for and challenges to development

What information is needed to develop a vaccine? How have vaccines for other viruses such as H1N1 been developed?

### Diagnostics and Therapeutics for Viruses

Two major concerns within diagnosis include the detection of current infections in individuals with and without symptoms, and the detection of past exposure without an active infection.
In the latter category, identifying whether individuals can develop or have developed sustained immunity is also a major consideration.

Within therapeutics, some possible efforts include efforts to identify strategies for the management of symptoms as well as the development of antivirals...

In this review, we seek to consolidate information about efforts to develop strategies for diagnosis and therapeutics as new information is released by the scientific community.


## Pathogenesis {.page_break_before}

### Mechanism of Host Infection by SARS-CoV-2

This section would also be great for the introduction of zoonotic diseases which has been shown to be the origin of SARS-CoV2.

#### Primary Transmission and Viral Entry

[How does SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells?]
[What cells are primary infection sites for SARS-CoV-2?]
[What structural aspects allow for viral entry]?

#### Viral Replication, Spreading and Transmission

[Basic introduction into replication cycle]
[What is the basic reproductive rate]
[What are the routes of transmission]

### Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2

[Cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection]
[What is causing neutropenia and lymphopenia observed in COVID-19 patients]
[Antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 by patient who recovered vs patient who did not recover]
[Cytokines and other soluble factors contribution to immune response]

### Systems level approaches for understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis

[Sandipan Ray volunteered to lead this section]


## Diagnostics  {.page_break_before} 

### Current Strategies for Diagnosing COVID-19 and Similar Viral Infections

Given the heterogeneity of symptom presentation across patients with COVID-19, the development of standardized protocols for testing samples for SARS-CoV-2 is urgent.
Following the release of the genetic sequence of the virus by Chinese officials on January 12, 2020, the first tests for detecting the virus were released on XX, 2020.
These tests used the following approach to identify the active virus in patient samples...
However, many countries have struggled to acquire the tests required to keep pace with the epidemic.
[Why is it so difficult to scale up testing? What are some of the considerations?]

### Possible Alternatives to Current Practices for Identifying Active Cases

[Are there other approaches that have worked for diagnosing other viruses at a rapid pace in large numbers of people?] 
[What are some approaches people are currently testing for detecting live viruses, especially SARS-CoV-2?]

### Detection of Past Exposure and/or Sustained Immunity

[What are approaches that allow us to detect past exposure for other viruses?] 
[What efforts are underway to develop similar approaches for SARS-CoV-2?]
[What is sustained immunity and what are the indicators?]

### Limitations to Implementation of Large-Scale Testing

[Right now, reagent supply is an issue. Are there others concerns that are likely to emerge?]

### Stratgies and Considerations for Determining Whom to Test 

[If it's not possible to test everyone, what strategies exist for selecting who to test?]
[Are these strategies likely to change over time? Presumably there are different stages of managing spread vs mitigating severity once it's already at high prevalence?]


## Therapeutics {.page_break_before} 

Given the rapid predicted spread of the disease, the development of therapeutics will be critical to mitigating its effect on health and the mortality rate.
Typically, therapeutics can take a few forms.
First, the treatment and reduction of symptoms can result in the reduction of the severity and risk associated with an active infection.
Second, the development of antiviral drugs can drive a reduced recovery time for patients by inhibiting the development of the virus once an individual is infected.
Finally, vaccines present a strategy for bolstering the immune response of the populus broadly to the virus, resulting in a lower rate of infection.
All three of these strategies have been valuable elements of responses to other viruses, including coronaviruses, and are being investigated by researchers at present.
Additionally, there have been suggestions within the scientific community that nutraceutical or dietary supplement interventions may prime an individual’s immune system to prevent or lessen the impact of RNA virus infections [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007; @doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30305-6]. 
In the following sections, we critically appraise the literature surrounding the repurposing of existing treatments and development of novel therapeutics for the prevention, mitigation, and treatment of coronavirus infections.
