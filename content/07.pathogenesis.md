## Pathogenesis {.page_break_before}

### Mechanism of Host Infection by SARS-CoV-2

This section would also be great for the introduction of zoonotic diseases which has been shown to be the origin of SARS-CoV2.

#### Primary Transmission and Viral Entry

[How does SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells?]
[What cells are primary infection sites for SARS-CoV-2?]
[What structural aspects allow for viral entry]?

#### Viral Replication, Spreading and Transmission

[Basic introduction into replication cycle]
[What is the basic reproductive rate]
[What are the routes of transmission]

### Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2

[Cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection]
[What is causing neutropenia and lymphopenia observed in COVID-19 patients]
[Antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 by patient who recovered vs patient who did not recover]
[Cytokines and other soluble factors contribution to immune response]

### Systems level approaches for understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis

[Sandipan Ray volunteered to lead this section]
