## Abstract {.page_break_before} 
Since late 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread around the world, resulting in the declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
This infectious disease is caused by the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
Research on the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the diease it causes is emerging rapidly through global scientific efforts.
The development of diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines will be critical to mitigating the impact of the virus.
Here we present a collaborative effort to organize and consolidate the rapidly emerging scientific literature related to SARS-CoV-2. 
We present information about the virus in the context of what is known about related viruses and synthesize studies emerging about the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 alongside literature about related illnesses.
A broad scientific effort to understand this pandemic and related viruses and diseases will be foundational to efforts to predict possible interventions. 
This text is an evolving and collaborative document that seeks to incorporate the ever-expanding body of information related to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
