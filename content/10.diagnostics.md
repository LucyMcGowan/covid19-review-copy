### Current Strategies for Diagnosing COVID-19 and Similar Viral Infections

Given the heterogeneity of symptom presentation across patients with COVID-19, the development of standardized protocols for testing samples for SARS-CoV-2 is urgent.
Following the release of the genetic sequence of the virus by Chinese officials on January 12, 2020, the first tests for detecting the virus were released on XX, 2020.
These tests used the following approach to identify the active virus in patient samples...
However, many countries have struggled to acquire the tests required to keep pace with the epidemic.
[Why is it so difficult to scale up testing? What are some of the considerations?]

### Possible Alternatives to Current Practices for Identifying Active Cases

[Are there other approaches that have worked for diagnosing other viruses at a rapid pace in large numbers of people?] 
[What are some approaches people are currently testing for detecting live viruses, especially SARS-CoV-2?]

### Detection of Past Exposure and/or Sustained Immunity

[What are approaches that allow us to detect past exposure for other viruses?] 
[What efforts are underway to develop similar approaches for SARS-CoV-2?]
[What is sustained immunity and what are the indicators?]

### Limitations to Implementation of Large-Scale Testing

[Right now, reagent supply is an issue. Are there others concerns that are likely to emerge?]

### Stratgies and Considerations for Determining Whom to Test 

[If it's not possible to test everyone, what strategies exist for selecting who to test?]
[Are these strategies likely to change over time? Presumably there are different stages of managing spread vs mitigating severity once it's already at high prevalence?]
