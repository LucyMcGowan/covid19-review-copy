## Therapeutics {.page_break_before} 

Given the rapid predicted spread of the disease, the development of therapeutics will be critical to mitigating its effect on health and the mortality rate.
Typically, therapeutics can take a few forms.
First, the treatment and reduction of symptoms can result in the reduction of the severity and risk associated with an active infection.
Second, the development of antiviral drugs can drive a reduced recovery time for patients by inhibiting the development of the virus once an individual is infected.
Finally, vaccines present a strategy for bolstering the immune response of the populus broadly to the virus, resulting in a lower rate of infection.
All three of these strategies have been valuable elements of responses to other viruses, including coronaviruses, and are being investigated by researchers at present.
Additionally, there have been suggestions within the scientific community that nutraceutical or dietary supplement interventions may prime an individualâ€™s immune system to prevent or lessen the impact of RNA virus infections [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007; @doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30305-6]. 
In the following sections, we critically appraise the literature surrounding the repurposing of existing treatments and development of novel therapeutics for the prevention, mitigation, and treatment of coronavirus infections.  

### Treatment of Symptoms

Possible background needed:
-COVID-19 is characterized by...
-The most severe and concerning symptoms are typically...
-The symptoms most often regarded as the proximal cause of death from COVID-19 are...
-Other diseases with similar symptoms include XYZ but these diseases may be different because...
-Given what we know about the mechanisms of the virus and why it produces the symptoms we see, are there drugs or categories of intervention that might be relevant?

So far, some strategies for reducing the severity of symptoms have included...

#### Symptom Management Approach 1

Brief background on the therapeutic.

##### Anticipated Mechanism 

Why it may be useful

##### Current Evidence

A list of current studies and their results, using carefully the information requested in the therapeutic paper tickets.

##### Summary

Summarize the state of the symptom management approach.

### Antivirals

Antivirals are an emerging category of drugs.
Unlike antibiotics, they do not kill viruses.
Rather, they inhibit the proliferation of a virus.
Categories may include therapies that inhibit viral proteins, inhibit viral entry, and more
Antivirals have been used to treat XYZ diseases through [what mechanisms or approaches are used?]

### Vaccines

Vaccines, widely recognized as one of the most significant advances in human health during the 20th century, can be used to bolser both individual and herd immunity to a virus by promoting the development of antibodies without infection.
[Are vaccines available for other coronaviruses or related viral illnesses?]
[What are some of the challenges to developing a vaccine? What needs to be taken into account about how the virus works?]
[Are there any challenges or opportunities unique to coronaviruses and/or SARS-CoV-2?]

### Neutralizing Antibodies

Monoclonal antibodies targeting viral antigens have shown therapeutic efficacy against viruses like Ebola and SARS CoV [@doi:10.1517/14712590902763755; @doi:10.1126/science.aad5224].
The first human neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 targeting the trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins has been developed [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.11.987958].
